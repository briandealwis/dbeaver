Now you need to choose the database connection against which to run the search – expand the tree in the **Objects Source** field to the database connections level and click the required database connection.  
In the **Object Types** field, you can select the database objects among which DBeaver will run the metadata search – select or clear the checkboxes.  
You can specify if the metadata should start with or contain or be similar to the search combination (**Name match** field). You can also set the maximum number of results to display (**Max results** field) and apply **Case-sensitive** search.

After you click **Search**, the results open in a [Search](https://github.com/dbeaver/dbeaver/wiki/Search) view:

Double-clicking a row in the Search view opens the respective object in a dedicated [Database Object editor](https://github.com/dbeaver/dbeaver/wiki/Database-Object-Editor).
