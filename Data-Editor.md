The Data editor appears:
* As the **Data** tab of the [Database Object Editor](https://github.com/dbeaver/dbeaver/wiki/Database-Object-Editor) available only for tables and views.
* As the **Results** tab when you run a custom SQL query in [SQL Editor](https://github.com/dbeaver/dbeaver/wiki/SQL-Editor)

The Data editor allows viewing and editing the data of a database table or view.
The central part of the Data editor is the data table. The editor also provides two toolbars and a filter field:

To learn how many rows the data table contains, click the **Calculate total row count** button in the bottom toolbar. The number of rows appears in a status field next to the button: ![](images/ug/Calculate-rows-button.png)

**Advanced Paste**|Pastes several values delimited with a tabulation or line break
**Delete**|Deletes the row that has the cell in focus<br/> NOTE: In fact, when users click **Delete**, the system only highlights the row red while the actual deletion happens when users click **Save**.
**Edit cell**|-	For CLOB/BLOB data format, opens the contents of the cell in a new tab<br/> - For all formats except CLOB/BLOB, opens a properties window for the cell<br/>
**Inline edit**|- Same as double-click on a cell<br/>- Makes the cell editable
**Set to NULL**|Sets the value of selected cells to NULL

The submenu contains the most common filters that can be applied to the cell in focus – see details in [Data Filters article](https://github.com/dbeaver/dbeaver/wiki/Data-Filters).<br/> By default, DBeaver filters data by sending a request to the server (the Server-side results ordering checkbox selected). To filter data on the client side using DBeaver`s internal algorithm, clear the checkbox.
